# LudumDare-41-Entry
My entry to ludumdare 41, Theme: "Combine 2 Incompatible Genres"

Unity will be used to create the game. 
For art I am using 2-3 different applications (firealpacha, aseprite, marmoset hexels 3)
And for music and sound I am using Lmms (and maybe audacity).

For aesthetics I take inspiration from the old game and watch games.

The game will be a puzzle/action/turn-based rpg/platformer... this might be too much...

The setting might be the wild west (or something), the player wakes up in a cell room from which he/she can escape.
The player will be able to attack enemies using punches, potions for regaining health must be picked up before use (also: items will be in the game).
